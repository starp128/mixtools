pty.c
gcc -g -o pty pty.c

read from stdin and write them to the master pseudo-terminal

open the slave side of this pseudo-terminal just like a real terminal
i.e. bash </dev/pts/5 ;;the name may defer which will get from pty.c
now the bash is using /dev/pts/5 as stdin and whth its stdout not changed.
